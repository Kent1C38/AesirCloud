  # Aesir Cloud
  This project is an experimental Minecraft server orchestrator written in Rust. It's main purpose is to easily manage multiple Minecraft servers throug a command line interpreter (CLI)

  ## Objectives:
  - Handling plugin loaders such as:
    - Paper
    - Purpur
    - [Yggdrasil](https://github.com/Kent1C38/Yggdrasil) (my custom Minestom loader)
  - Handling mod loaders (not my priority for now)
  - 2 types of servers: static and disposable ones
  - No need to care about which Java version is needed: it will handle it for you
  - Auto detection of down servers to restart it if the config specifies so
  - If I manage to learn Web devleoppment, setting up a Web Administration Panel

  ## This project is still in developpment
