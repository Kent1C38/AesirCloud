# Aesir Cloud

Aesir Cloud is an **experimental Minecraft server orchestrator written in Rust**, designed to make managing multiple Minecraft servers simple and efficient through a **command-line interface (CLI)**.

## Objectives

Aesir Cloud aims to provide:

- **Plugin loader management**, supporting:
  - Paper
  - Purpur
  - [Yggdrasil](https://github.com/Kent1C38/Yggdrasil) (custom Minestom loader)
- **Mod loader support** (not a priority yet)
- **Multiple server types**:
  - Static servers (long-running, persistent)
  - Disposable servers (temporary, on-demand)
- **Automatic Java management** – no need to worry about which Java version is required
- **Server monitoring and auto-restart** – detects down servers and restarts them if configured
- **Future web administration panel** – planned if web development is implemented

## Status

This project is currently **under active development** and **not yet production-ready**.
